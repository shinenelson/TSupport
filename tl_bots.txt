{QUESTION}
Long wait
{COMMENT}
Anything longer than 3-4 hours is a long wait.
{KEYS}
lw
{VALUE}
Hello. Sorry for the long wait.

{QUESTION}
Newbie
{KEYS}
noob
{VALUE}
Sorry, the bot platform is a feature for devlopers, not end users. There is no out-of-the-box way to create a bot - you'll need at least some skills at computer programming to build one.

But you can always check out @storebot to see what others are making. (this bot itself was not created by us)

{QUESTION}
Examples
{KEYS}
ex
{VALUE}
Here are a few open source examples we have on the web. Maybe they will help:

Java

Sending a message with replyKeyboard:

Python

Documentation with Python examples:

PHP

Ruby

We're working on a new Bot FAQ with examples. Stay Tuned. Coming soon.

{QUESTION}
Where do I find all the bots?
{KEYS}
storebot
{VALUE}
We'll see how the platform grows. As soon as there are enough interesting bots, we'll definitely find a way to showcase them to you.

For now, you can use solutions from third-party developers, like @storebot for example.

{QUESTION}
Suggestions
{COMMENT}
Use this template at the beginning, then add a few lines about the actual suggestion the user made.
{KEYS}
fd
{VALUE}
Thanks for the feedback!

The bot API is still in its infancy right now. There are many potential features to consider and implement. We'll be studying what people do with their bots for a while to see which directions will be most important for the platform.

{QUESTION}
Webhooks don't work
{KEYS}
wh
{VALUE}
You'll need a valid certificate for webhooks to work. Please note that we currently do not support self-signed certificates.

At the moment, we support ports 88, 443, 8443 and 80 for webhooks.

{QUESTION}
Webhooks authentication
{KEYS}
wha
{VALUE}
If you'd like to make sure that the Webhook request comes from Telegram, we recommend using a secret path in the URL, e.g. www.example.com/your_token. Since nobody else knows your bot's token, you can be pretty sure it's us.

{QUESTION}
Download files
{KEYS}
dl
{VALUE}
Sorry, bots cannot download files (or media) yet. The only thing they can do for now is send them on to users (by file_id).

We're still working on the API and many more options will become available in the future.
